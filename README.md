# Student project in Artificial Intelligence

This project addresses the often-overlooked ethical, environmental, and philosophical aspects of AI. It is mainly (but not exclusively) based on the [Atlas of AI](https://katecrawford.net/atlas).

You can check out this Obsidian Vault in an online markdown renderer [here](https://tanguyhardion.github.io/obsidian-renderer/), coded for the occasion.
